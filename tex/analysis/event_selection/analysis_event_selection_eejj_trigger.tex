\subsection{Trigger}
\label{sec:eejjTrigger}

Events in the \eejj~channel are selected online using unprescaled double photon or double electron triggers,
depending on the run period.
These triggers require the presence of two clusters in the ECAL, each with a transverse
energy $\et > 33$~GeV and each matched to hits in the pixel detector.  The triggers
also require the absence of significant energy deposits in the HCAL cells directly behind the ECAL clusters.
The exact trigger used depends on the run period.
The full list of triggers for the \eejj~channel and their associated run periods are are 
listed in Table~\ref{tab:eejjDoublePhotEleHLT}.

The efficiency with which these triggers select events with two HEEP electrons 
(described in Section~\ref{sec:id-electron}) has been studied in the context of the Z'$\rightarrow \mbox{ee}$ 
analysis~\cite{zprime-2011}, and it is taken to be 100\% with less than 1\% uncertainty.
A fully efficient trigger is also assumed in the \eejj~channel.
Events used for background estimates are not required to pass these triggers:
data-driven background estimates use different triggers, and MC events are not required to pass any trigger.
