\section{Event selection in the \eejj~channel}
\label{sec:eejjSelection}

This section describes the event selection for the search
for leptoquarks in the decay channel $\text{LQ}\overline{\text{LQ}}\rightarrow eejj$.
The two leading electrons and two leading jets in \pt~in each event are used 
for this analysis.  
Section \ref{sec:eejjTrigger} describes the trigger requirements.
Section \ref{sec:eejjPreselection} describes the preselection level of the search.
Section \ref{sec:eejjOptimization} describes the optimization of the final selection level of the search, and
Section \ref{sec:eejjFinalSelection} describes the results observed at that final selection level.
