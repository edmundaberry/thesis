\chapter{Analysis: Event selection}
\label{ch:analysis-event-selection}

This chapter describes the process
by which events are selected for both channels of this analysis.
The event filters which are common to both channels are
described in Section \ref{sec:event-filters}.
The \eejj~channel  is described in Section \ref{sec:eejjSelection}.
The \enujj~channel is described in Section \ref{sec:enujjSelection}.
Both channels make use of the datasets described in Chapter \ref{ch:analysis-samples}, but
the methods for modeling the various data-driven backgrounds
and renormalizing the MC backgrounds are discussed in the following
chapter (Chapter \ref{ch:analysis-backgrounds}).
