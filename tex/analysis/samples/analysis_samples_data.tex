\section{Data samples}
\label{sec:data-samples}

The datasets used for this analysis were collected by the CMS detector during 2011, when
the LHC was operating with a collision energy of 7 TeV.  The entire 2011 dataset
corresponds to an  integrated luminosity of \lumi. 
Only data that were taken during a period with stable
LHC beams and with all CMS subdetectors operating without problems was used in the analysis.
Known dead or noisy channels in the calorimeters were masked in the reconstruction.
The average number of pile-up interactions for the first period of data 
taking ({\it Run2011A}, from March to August, 2011) was approximately \NpileupA.
For the second period of data taking ({\it Run2011B}, from September to October, 2011) the average
number of pile-up interactions was approximately \NpileupB. 
The average number of pile-up interactions over the entire 
data sample considered is approximately \Npileup.

For the \eejj~channel, the data stored in the {\it Photon} PD
were used as reported in Table~\ref{tab:PhotonDataset}. The events used in this channel  
were collected by unprescaled double-photon or double-electron triggers as described in 
Section~\ref{sec:eejjTrigger}.

For the \enujj~channel, the data stored in the {\it SingleElectron} and 
{\it ElectronHad}  PDs were used as reported in Table~\ref{tab:SingleElectronPlusElectronHadDataset}. 
The events used in this channel were collected by unprescaled  single-electron or 
electron-PFMHT-jet-jet triggers as described in Section~\ref{sec:enujjTrigger}.

For the determination of the \ttbar~background in the \eejj~channel, the data stored in the {\it MuEG} PD
were used as reported in Table~\ref{tab:MuEGDataset}. The events used in this study  
were collected by unprescaled muon-plus-photon or muon-plus-electron triggers as described 
in Section~\ref{sec:eejjTTbarBkg}.

Finally, for the determination of the QCD multijet background in both the \eejj and \enujj channels, 
the data stored in the {\it Photon} PD were used as reported in Table~\ref{tab:PhotonDataset}. 
The events used in this study were collected by prescaled single-photon triggers as 
described in Section~\ref{sec:qcd}.
