\section{Other backgrounds (diboson, single top, and others)}
\label{sec:OtherBkg}

The following SM processes give a small contribution to the total background in both \eejj~and 
\enujj~analyses: single top, diboson, $\gamma$ + jets, \zjets~(only in the \enujj~channel), 
and \wjets~(only in the \eejj~channel). The selection efficiencies for these backgrounds are derived from MC, 
and the samples are normalized to the cross sections listed in Section~\ref{sec:mc-samples}.
