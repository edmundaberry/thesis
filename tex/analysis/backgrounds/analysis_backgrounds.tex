\chapter{Analysis: Standard Model backgrounds}
\label{ch:analysis-backgrounds}

This chapter describes the various background estimates 
that are used throughout this thesis for both the \eejj~and \enujj~channels.
All of the dominant backgrounds are either purely data driven
or are derived from MC samples that have been rescaled to match
data within control regions.
Section \ref{sec:qcd} describes the data driven QCD multijet background estimate.
Section \ref{sec:ttbar} describes the \ttbar~estimates for the \eejj~channel (purely data driven)
and the \enujj~channel (derived from MC samples rescaled within a control region).
Section \ref{sec:vjets} describes the \zjets~and \wjets~background estimates 
(also derived from MC samples rescaled within a control region) and other background 
estimates (derived from MC samples scaled only by cross sections listed in Section \ref{sec:mc-samples}).
