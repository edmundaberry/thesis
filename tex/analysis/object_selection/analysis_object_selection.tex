\chapter{Analysis: Object selection}
\label{ch:analysis-object-selection}

Electron candidates (Section \ref{sec:reco-electron}),
muon candidates (Section \ref{sec:reco-muon}),
jets, and \met~(Section \ref{sec:jetmet}) are all reconstructed
with very loose identification requirements, which are designed
to be inclusive for a broad range of analyses.  
To better reject various backgrounds while still preserving an
efficient selection on leptoquarks, additional
identification criteria are applied to all of these physics object
candidates.  These criteria are all detailed in this chapter.
