A search for the pair-production of first generation scalar leptoquarks
is performed in final states consisting of two electrons and at least
two jets or an electron, a neutrino, and at least two jets using 
proton-proton collision data at $\sqrt{s} = 7$~TeV.  The data were collected
by the Compact Muon Solenoid detector at the Large Hadron Collider in 2011 
and correspond to an integrated luminosity of 4.95 $\text{fb}^{-1}$.  
The number of observed events in both final states is observed to be in good agreement with 
the predictions for Standard Model processes.  A 95\% confidence level combined lower limit is set on the mass of a
first generation scalar leptoquark at 830 and 640 GeV for $\beta = 1$ and 0.5, respectively,
where $\beta$ is the branching fraction of the leptoquark to an electron and a quark.
